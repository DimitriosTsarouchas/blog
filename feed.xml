However, that might lead to unintended exposure of its features to even non-experts at both sides, authorised and unauthorised users. Malware that exploits its weak spots is a prevalent technique. A malware named “TrickBot” is... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Threat Actors</title><link href="https://dimitrios-tsarouchas.tech//posts/Threat-Actors/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Threat Actors" /><published>2021-02-26T12:55:00+00:00</published> <updated>2021-05-05T13:44:41+01:00</updated> <id>https://dimitrios-tsarouchas.tech//posts/Threat-Actors/</id> <content src="https://dimitrios-tsarouchas.tech//posts/Threat-Actors/" /> <author> <name>Dimitrios Tsarouchas</name> </author> <category term="Cybersecurity" /> <category term="Information Security" /> <summary> Threat Actor types and Attributes When we talk about threat actors we mean those people or organisations that actually attack an organisation’s infrastructure. Security operations teams must ensure that an organisation stays informed and battles against any type of threat actor.

Now, by saying functionality we mean that the systems must function as users need them to function, so they can interact with the data needed. Security simply means that an organisation increases the protection lev... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Local File Inclusion CTF</title><link href="https://dimitrios-tsarouchas.tech//posts/Local-File-Inclusion-CTF/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Local File Inclusion CTF" /><published>2021-02-02T12:55:00+00:00</published> <updated>2021-03-11T00:13:03+00:00</updated> <id>https://dimitrios-tsarouchas.tech//posts/Local-File-Inclusion-CTF/</id> <content src="https://dimitrios-tsarouchas.tech//posts/Local-File-Inclusion-CTF/" /> <author> <name>Dimitrios Tsarouchas</name> </author> <category term="CTFs" /> <category term="TryHackMe" /> <summary> Introduction In this article we are going to capture root flag on a Linux machine using Local File Inclusion vulnerability.

This will be done by using the Path Traversal technique. We will get access to a local user account by cracking its password hash and then elevate our privileges, get access as superuser and find the flag. What is Local File Inclusion?
